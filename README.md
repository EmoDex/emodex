## Data security
Your data is instantly deleted after being rated by our model. We do not log your inputs. The model is not trained on any users data.
## Techstack

## Language support
Your language is not supported? No worries. In our research we have found that most translation tools have a very high quality in preserving a texts emotion keywords. Simply translate your text to english and classify the outcome with our tool. Make sure however to keep the emoticons and emojis untouched, as those carry significant meaning.
